# Analysis of Tweets from the 2016 Debates

This repository contains several scripts used to analyze around 1.5 million tweets from
the 2016 presidential debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. One of my friends scraped
all of the tweets using a [project](https://github.com/DavidPurcell/OmNomTweets) he did for a class a while back, and posted on one of our groups
about them, so I decided to have some fun one night and came up with this.

# Wordclouds

I created a bunch of word clouds based on the tweets and hashtags used during the debates.
You can find the raw images in the repo or look below.
